This repo contains a hacked-together Emacs package that depends on Clojure mode being installed.
It will hopefully be rewritten and put into one of the package managers eventually.

Any contributions are most welcome!

## Configuration

Add this to your configuration file:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/your/path/to/carp-emacs")

(require 'carp-mode)
(require 'inf-carp-mode)

;; Use carp-mode for .carp files
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.carp\\'" . carp-mode))
```

To start an interactive session, make sure `carp` is in your path (inside Emacs) and execute `M-x run-carp`.

## Flycheck

This minor mode is highly recommended -- Carp's type errors are much easier to understand when they can be seen visually in the source code.

```
(require 'carp-flycheck)

(add-hook 'carp-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (flycheck-mode 1)))
```

## Goto Definition (Xref)

Using Carp's Repl with Emacs's Xref you can jump to the definition of
variables and functions. Simply add the following config to register
it when working in a carp file

```
(require 'carp-xref)

(add-hook 'carp-mode-hook
	(lambda ()
		(push 'carp-xref-backend xref-backend-functions)))
```
